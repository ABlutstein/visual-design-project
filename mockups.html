      <h1>Mock ups of website</h1>
    </div>
    <p>
      For the mock ups of my web project I used a photoshop web medium 1440 x
      900px @72dpi canvas. I also chose a 12 column layout with a 20px gutter.
      The 12 column layout allowed me the ability to ensure symmetry of the
      overall design and to have a consistent feel about the website pages.
      Because I was creating a children’s website, I therefore had to think
      differently from a standard web project. The main difference having spoken
      to parents and using my daughter as an example, was that children are
      looking for fun and to learn when visiting a website rather than looking
      for information which is the usual purpose for an adult. I therefore had
      to consider a range of options including entertainment, education, games,
      videos, puzzles or painting. I also had to ensure that the website was
      exciting and would grab the attention of the child so as to want to find
      out more and limit the amount of text. My target audience is between 3-6
      years old, and I needed to accommodate this broad age group where the
      learning differences could be significant. I therefore chose bright
      colours to capture the attention of children as well as cute characters
      which I used my daughter’s soft toys for. For the purpose of this project
      I created sections that included a book search page that parents would be
      involved in using alongside their child, a painting page and a things to
      do page. The homepage would act as a portal to these other sections. I
      chose primary and secondary colours - red, blue, yellow, green, purple and
      orange which are all happy colours and vivid. For the navigation menu bar
      I opted for both icon and text, which would give both younger and older
      children the ability to navigate the website. I used the font My Kids
      Handwritten Basic downloaded from Google fonts. This font has a feel of
      being child like but at the same time easy to read.

      <p>
        For the homepage I wanted the design to be happy, fun and amusing with
        my daughter’s soft toys being used for Babbit and owl in realistic
        scenarios of painting and reading. The character images would be
        clickable and an arrow feature on the left and right wound rotate the
        character to the front.

      <h2>Mock up 2 - Book search page:</h2>
      <p>Final mock up:</p>
      <div class="Image-edited">

      <p>
        The book search page is aimed at older children who have just started to
        read and looking for a new book. There would be strict parental controls
        on the book search itself and there would be a modal notice advising
        that it is best to supervise children when using this search facility. I
        used a background image from Freepik that looked like a private library
        with Owl sitting reading a book. The book search facility is on top of a
        large book image inviting children to search for a book.

        Having done my research into what applications should be included in the
        website, painting was highlighted as being on the top. I therefore
        designed this page by focusing of usability for the child. I used a dark
        painting canvas with slight opacity for the child to see the background,
        which some children it was pointed by other parents would like to trace
        as was the case for some other painting applications. I also created a
        six colour palette along a artist’s mixer palette. For usability I added
        a rubber, undo and delete option within the canvas itself. On the corner
        of the canvas is Babbit painting at his easel to give the page more of a
        fun feel.

      <h2>Mock up 4 - Things to do page:</h2>
      <p>Final mock up:</p>

      <p>
        The Things to do page is also aimed at older children who have just
        started school and may need to start thinking about planning their
        homework. The things to do list is featured within a blackboard with the
        input and other features all designed to look like chalk marks. There is
        a check button when a thing to do is completed and the option to delete
        when no longer required. This page is designed with a cartoon bedroom
        image from freepik and some opacity to fade out the vibrancy of the
        image. I added a picture of Babbit in the background to make the room
        feel more personal.
