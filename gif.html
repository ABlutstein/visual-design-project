        Format: GIF. Dimensions: 480w x 270h. Size: 221.7K. Settings: Selective,
        128 Colours, Pattern Dither, 25 frames, Transparency on. No Transparency
        Dither. Non-Interlaced, 0% Web Snap. The GIF I have created would be
        intended to promote a children’s event where kids could meet Babbit and
        her friends in person at an organised activity day for children on a
        particular date, which I have prompted as August 21st for indication
        purposes for the assessment.

        The text is limited and large enough for children to be able to read
        clearly and is legible with white text on a dark background. My Babbit
        event Gif is an indication of how such a promotion could be used through
        flashing headlines where appropriate and animation. I have used 25
        frames each set at 0.2seconds per frame. It could be used on the Babbit
        website or on other commercial online promotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The size of the gif of 480w x 270h allows the image to be large enough
        for children to visualise properly on a website rather than a more
        traditional box size of 200x 200 alternative which would be too small
        for most children to notice. This hasn’t affected the Gif size, which is
        much smaller than the maximum recommended gif of 8MB coming in at only
        221.K.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used Pattern rather than diffusion because Pattern uses a square
        pattern of colour and simulates the missing colours. I found that
        diffusion selected a random pattern of colours and the gif created
        stripes across the screen. The increase in size was not significant,
        therefore I decided to use Pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose a night scene as I felt it helped to focus more on Babbit and
        gave the flashing text and nose more emphasis. The Gif is intended to
        make the child feel that Babbit is travelling on her toy kitty by using
        animation that followed the road down and across the screen. The Gif
        ends with a large image of Babbit and her nose flashing with a small
        smile.
