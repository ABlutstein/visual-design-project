      <h1>Aaron Blutstein's Visual Design Final Project</h1>
      <p>
        I wanted to develop a small website specifically for children of between
        3-6 years old where they could safely play online with a range of
        features without having to leave the website to look for similar
        activities in different locations. I looked towards my daughter for the
        type of activities I should develop, this included a painting
        application as she constantly attempts to try and draw with a computer
        mouse. I also developed other applications that would appeal more to
        older children around 5 years old as they learn to look for books and
        start typing, therefore the website needed to include such features that
        would keep this age group interested too. The theme of the overall
        website was focused around my daughter’s favourite soft toys - a rabbit
        that she calls ‘BABBIT, and an owl. By using soft toys in real-life
        scenarios it is the intention of the website to make the feel of the
        overall website more fun and appealing.
