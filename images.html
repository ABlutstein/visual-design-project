        Final Image Format: Saved using the save for web option in export, which 
        allows me to save the image optiamlly for website usage. PNG-24 
        Dimensions: 400w x 566h Size: 140.5K Settings:
        Non-Interlaced, Transparency on, 26sec@56.6kbps, Internet Standard
        RGB/sRGB IEC61966-2.1. Original psd file Size: 21.5MB. I chose PNG 24
        over PNG 8 because PNG‑24 format preserves the subtle variations
        in brightness and hue found in images and is recommended when you work
        with an image that includes multiple levels of partial transparency,
        which was appropiate for this final image. Having explored PNG 8 I found
        that it reduced the quality of the final image and produced a subtle
        outline which I wanted to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image is for a series of final pieces for my website that I am
        specifically designing for my daughter. The images intend to re-create
        real life scenarios for my daughter's favourite toys. I want by daughter
        to enjoy some of the things that I enjoy such as painting and drawing.
        Although natural to children, lots of distractions can prevent my
        daughter from doing these things. I therefore thought that by recreating
        some of her favourite toys in fun scenrios it may encourage her to the
        same activities as her toys.
      </p>
      <p>Image production in Photoshop:</p>
      <p>I first imported the easel picture into Photoshop. I then duplicated the
      layer.</p>
      </p>
      <p>
        I then Imported the front facing image, with no paint brush, of my
        daughter's rabbit soft toy and again duplicated the layer. I then went to
        Filter > Filter Gallery > Sketches > Glowing Edges. I inversed the
        image to create an outine effect of the rabbit which would then be used
        for the painting image within the final image. I then manioulated the
        colours in Image > Adjustments > Color Balance by changing the midtones,
        shadows and highights.
      </p>
      <p>
            Having achieved the required effect of the rabbit image, I then needed
            to cut out the surrounding white background from the easel as I wanted
            to achieve a transparent background for the final image, as it was going
            to be used for a link image on the homepage. I did this by selecting the
            quick select tool to highlight the areas I wanted to remove. I then
            cleaned up any rough edges by using the eraser tool.
          </p>
      <p>
        Once this was done I then had to erase the girl painting. I did this with the 
        lasso tool as the quick select and magic
        tools would not define the correct areas. I then needed to clone certain
        areas of the easel on the image where the girl had been.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then needed to to cut out the background of the rabbit with the paint
        brush. I did this using the quick select tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was then able to postion the rabbit in the image where the girl
        painter had been.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next stage was to position the edited front facing image of the rabbit onto
        the canvas. This required me to create perspective. I did this by
        firstly roughly placing the rabbit image into position and then
        selecting Edit > Perspective Warp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then cleaned up the iamge where required.

        Having explored PNG 8 I found that it reduced the quality of the final
        image and produced a subtle outline which I wanted to avoid. I therfore
        felt the increased size of a PNG 24 was worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As explained for image 1, I want to design images that mimick real life
        scenarios for my daughter's favourite toys. I want to encourage my
        daughter to read therefore by bringing together her first soft toy
        (which happens to be a wise owl) and a book I hope to encourage her to
        be curious about reading.
      </p>
      <p>Image production in Photoshop:</p>
      <p>I first imported the blue chair image into Photoshop. I then duplicated
      the layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then Imported the image of my daughter's owl soft toy and again
        duplicated the layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point I then went to Image > Adjustment > Color balance. to
        change the colour of the owl to one of my daughter's favourite colours -
        yellow. I did this by changing the midtones, shadows and highights.
      </p>
      <p>
      Having achieved the required colour of the owl, I then needed to cut out
      the surrounding white background from the chair as I wanted to achieve a
      transparent background for the final image, as it was going to be used for
      a link image on the homepage. I did this by selecting the magic tool to
      highlight the areas I wanted to remove. I then cleaned up any rough edges
      by using the eraser tool.
      <p>
      <p>
        I then wanted to place the owl soft toy image on to the chair so as to
        look relatively realistic. This required me to create perspective. I did
        this by firstly roughly placing the owl into position and then selecting
        Edit > Perspective Warp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then imported the images for the book. I then needed to follow a
        similar process to that of the owl by using Perspective Warp.

      <p>Final Image 3 profile:</p>

<p>Final Image Format: Saved using the save for web option in export, which 
        allows me to save the image optimally for website usage.
        
        Format: JPEG
        Dimensions: 800w x 357h Size: 78.6K. Settings: Quality is 60, Non-Progressive, Optimized on. 15sec@56.6kbps, Internet Standard
        RGB/sRGB IEC61966-2.1. Original psd file Size: 3.264MB. 
        
        I chose to use JPEG(high)over that of a PNG 24 format because the image would be used as a background and therfore wouldn't need to have any transparency. A PNG 8 would have reduced image quality, and although a PNG 24 wouldn't have lossed any image quality it had a file size of 456K and 91sec download. Using the JPEG format reduced the size from 456K down to 78.6K without any image loss and therefore also increased its speed. Therefore for the purpose of this image, a JPEG was the better format.
</p>
        
        <p>The reason for using this image would be to put the characters within a street setting to give them more of a feeling of a setting that my daughter could imagine the characters living in. </p>

        <p>Image production in Photoshop:</p>
        <p>I first imported the image of the street scene into Photoshop. I then duplicated
        the layer.
        </p>
        <p>
        
            <p>
                The image was very dark, and made it look rather sinister which is not what I wanted. Therefore to change this I identified areas of the image that needed light changes. The background of the image where the street faded wasan area that need light enhancement, as well as one of the street lamps. The windows of the house also were also too dark, and the sky too dark and grey for a children's website.
            </p>
            <p>I first changed the brighness of the image to slightly increase the overall tone of the street scene by going to Image > Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast.</p>
            <p>
                I then used the lasso tool to choose the area of the street scene where the street faded out at the rear of the image and then went to Image > Adjustments > Color Balance to increase the yellow midtones. This gave the faded part of the image a slightly more welcoming feel. I also used the lasso tool to select the lamp in the street scene to increase the yellow and presence of the lamp glow.
            </p>
            <p>The next step was to enhance the windows of the house so that I could eventually place the rabbit image behind the window. At this stage the windwos were too dark and didn't reflect the feel I wanted. To do this I used the  use the lasso tool to select the window area as the quick select  and magic tool were unable to do this. I then went to Image in the menu bar and selected Auto Tone. This changed the windows suffiently so as not to need further tonal changes.</p>
            <p>At this stage I want to change the colour of the sky of the image to that of pink with clouds to give it a more child friendly feel. I did this by using the quick selector tool and then deleting the current sky. I then imported the image of the pink sky into the overal picture and placed it behind the main picture layer.</p>
            <p>
                At this stage the image feel had changed and the street scene felt more like what I wanted. I then intended to place the image of my daughter's rabbit and owl soft toys within the street scene. My intention was to place the rabbit behind one of the windows of the house looking out onto the street. And the owl to be placed on top of the pub sign.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first imported both the owl and rabbit images into Photoshop. In order to place the rabbit behind the window I need to use Perspective warp. I  firstly reduced the image of the rabbit to fit the size of the window, and then used Perspective Warp to create the required perspective. I then used image overlay, which placed the rabbit behind the window but not sufficently to give it a sense of realism. I therefore corrected the window frame with the paint brush to enhance the feeling of the rabbit behind the window. I then went to Image > Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast to increase the brightness of the rabbit image.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the owl I also needed to use Perspective Warp. I used the same process as for the rabbit by firstly placing the image into the required size and postion I wanted and then used Perspective Warp. I also wanted to change the colour of the owl to a twilight purple.  I therefore went to Color Balance to change to a more purple tone and used the shadows option to create a feeling of light on the owl from the street and natural light. It also felt balanced agains the pink sky.
     </p>
     <p>
         The final part of the image was to delete the text in the pub signage. I did this by clone areas of the sign so that no text was visible.  I then used the text tool to type what I wanted to say using the Baskerville Old Face font to give it a sense of age. I then used Perspective Warp for the text to place it within the pub sign.

      <p>
            Final Image Format: Saved using the save for web option in export, which 
        allows me to save the image optimally for website usage. 
        Format: PNG-24. Dimensions: 1000w x 625h. Size: 373.4K. Settings: Non-Interlaced, Transparency off 68sec@56.6kbps, Internet Standard
            RGB/sRGB IEC61966-2.1. Original psd file Size: 4.67MB.</p>
            <p>I chose to save the image as a PNG 24  over a JPEG because the image was to be used as the background for the website homepage and needed to be of a high enough quality but at an accessible size for maximum website optimisation on loading to achieve a higher performance but also future proof the image against compression loss. Image compression is about reducing the file size of an image as much as possible, without compromising the quality too much. In general, stronger compression = smaller file size = worse image quality. Good image compression is about finding a good trade off between file size and quality. JPEG uses a method of compression that groups together multiple similar pixels and kind of blurs the lines between things. Although for this  specifc image I would not be using 
                 transparency, a major difference between .jpg and .png images is that only the .png format supports transparent backgrounds. However the PNG 24 Format offers no loss compression and no visible loss of image quality over a JPEG. Thererfore it was logical to use a PNG 24 format over both a PNG 8, which refers to palette variant, and only supports  256 colors, but is usually smaller in size than a JPEG. Whereas a PNG 24 image has PNG files with 24 bit colors. This format can use more than 16 million available colors (224). Therefore, the information that can be stored in a PNG 24 file is much larger; hence the quality of the image is much better. It can use true color or RGB color schemes. Therefore, PNG 24 type is suitable for storing photographic images and images with sudden variations and broad range of colours. Therefore  the PNG 24 format was the best format for my final background image.
              </p>
              <p class="header">Image production in Photoshop:</p>
             
            <p>
I wanted the homepage background image for the website to be colourful and also reflect by daughter's preferences. I therefore chose a rainbow scene but needed to change the colour of the sky to a more cheerful Pink as indicated by my daughter. I firstly imported the rainbow scenic image into Photoshop, duplicated the layer and then proceeded to cut the grey sky out using the quick select option.
            </p>
            <p>I had looked at simply using the lasso tool and changing the colour  balance of specfic areas of the sky. However I felt that the sky needed clouds and my daughter wanted a pink sky in place of the blue one.</p>
            <p>
             I therefore imported the scenic cartoon style image with a pink sky and clouds into Photoshop.
            </p>
            <p>
            It was then necessary to place the pink sky image behind the rainbow pic image so that the sky would fill the space of the old sky as the rainbow image was now on top of the pink Sky.
        </P>
<p>I then proceeded to touch up the images to ensure that I hadn't missed any obvious  blemishes within the image. To do this I mainly used the clone tool to clone areas of the sky and clouds that didn't appear natural to the orginal rainbow image. I also used the paint brush and eraser tools.</p>

      <p>Like a few of the images I have exported, I chose PNG 24 over PNG 8 because PNG‑24 format preserves the subtle variations in brightness and hue found in images and I wanted to ensure limited quality loss as this image would be used on the homepage as a potential link and would not look smooth if I had used PNG 8 because it would have had subtle outlines.</p>
      <p class="header">Image production in Photoshop:</p>
      <p>I first imported the background image and cropped it to size</p>
      <p>I then imported the blackboard image and overlayed it on top of the background image.</p>
      <p>The final part of the process was more difficult and that was to create the chalk drawing of the owl soft toy. I first needed to import the image of the owl and used the quick slection tool to delete the background - cleaning up any jagged edges. To create the effect of the chalk image I duplicated the image of the owl and went to Filter > Sketch > Photocopy > and applied the effect to the duplicated layer.</p>
      <p>I then set the blend mode of the duplicated layer to screen. </p>
      <p>After this I used  Filter > Sketch > Graphic Pen and applied this to the original layer of the owl. I also added some gaussian blur.</p>
      <p>The next step was to set the blend mode of the orginal owl image to screen.</p>
      <p>The last of the chalk owl image was to add some text which would be used to help users identify what the potential image link was for. I wanted the text to appear within the blackboard to look like chalk but also to stand out, so I used the font Londrina Sketch which I felt was child like and sketchy.</p>

            in brightness and hue found in images and I wanted to ensure limited quality 
            loss as this image was possibly going to be used on the homepage of the final website.
            PNG 8 caused a thin white outline. PNG-8 refers to palette variant, which supports only 
            256 colours, but is usually smaller in size. PNG-8 can also be a GIF substitute. 
            PNG-24 refers to true color variant, which supports more colours, but might be bigger. 
            PNG-24 can also be used instead of JPEG, if lossless image format is needed, which I
            wanted to ensure was the case for this image as the image quality needed to be crisp yet 
            web optimised this gave the best option.

              <p>I then needed to cut out the background of the image because the 
                  final image would be used on the Homepage of my website as a link 
                  image. I selected the background area to be deleted by using the magic tool.

                  Having deleted the background I then proceeded to change the colour of the rabbit 
                  so that my daughter would laugh at the completely different colour of her favourite toy.
                  To do this I followed the same process as per my other images by going 
                  to Image > Adjustment > Color balance. I decided to choose green because it is a 
                  colour my daughter likes to point at. To change the colour of the rabbit to green I changed the midtones, shadows and 
                  highights to the required levels.

                <p>I also wanted to highlight the pink nose of the rabbit,
                     which was not that prevalent. Therefore I used the lasso tool 
                     to select the area of the nose I wanted to change and then painted 
                     the area with a deeper pink using the paint brush tool.</p>
